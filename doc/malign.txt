INTRODUCTION                                    *malign*

Install using the usual methods. (Pathogen, vim-plug, etc.)

COMMANDS                                        *malign-commands*

                                                *malign-:MAlignThis*
:MAlignThis                 Mark the current cursor position as the start of the text
                            you want to align.

                            Since you most frequently want to align with text
                            on the next or previous line, one of the other
                            variants of this command is usually more
                            convenient.

                            This mark is per-buffer.

                                                *malign-:MAlignThisWithPrevLine*
:MAlignThisWithPrevLine     Mark the current cursor position as the start of the text
                            you want to align, and move the cursor to the
                            previous line. This makes it easy to align with a
                            position on the previous line.

                                                *malign-:MAlignThisWithNextLine*
:MAlignThisWithNextLine     Mark the current cursor position as the start of the text
                            you want to align, and move the cursor to the next
                            line. This makes it easy to align with a position
                            on the next line.

                                                *malign-:MAlignToHere*
:MAlignToHere               Shift the text at the position marked by one of
                            the *:MAlignThis* variants so that it starts at
                            the column the cursor is currently on. If the
                            current column is to the right of the marked
                            column, spaces will be inserted at the marked
                            position to make things line up. If the current
                            column is to the left of the marked column,
                            characters will be deleted to the left of the
                            market position to line things up correctly.

MAPPINGS                                        *malign-default-mappings*

The following default mappings are provided. Set *g:malign_default_mappings* to
0 to disable them.

                                                *malign-MK*
MK                          Mark the current cursor position as the start of
                            the text you want to align, and move the cursor up
                            one line. This is equivalent to the
                            *:MAlignThisWithPrevLine* command.

                                                *malign-MJ*
MJ                          Mark the current cursor position as the start of
                            the text you want to align, and move the cursor
                            down one line. This is equivalent to the
                            *:MAlignThisWithNextLine* command.


                                                *malign-MM*
MM                          Shift the text at the position marked by *MK* or
                            *MJ* so that it starts at the column the cursor
                            is currently on. This is equivalent to the
                            *:MAlignToHere* command.
